- 👋 Hi, I’m @anna-konoreva
- 👀 I’m interested in Quality Assurance
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to automate test cases. I don't know any programming language and I haven't decided what language I should start to learn (JS / Python).
- 💞️ I’m looking for a job as a manual QA engineer
- 📫 How to reach me: I'm not sure you want to reach someone with an empty profile so I will fill out this line later
